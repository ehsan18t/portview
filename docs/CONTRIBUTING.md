Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust stable toolchain (1.93+)
- `cargo-deny` (optional, for dependency audit)
- Supported lint targets:

```bash
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

### Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ehsan18t/portview.git
cd portview
cargo build
```

Release builds use a size-focused Cargo profile (`opt-level = "z"`, LTO,
single codegen unit, symbol stripping, and `panic = "abort"`). Keep that bias
unless a maintainer explicitly decides a runtime-performance regression is more
important than artifact size.

Windows executable icon embedding expects `assets/icon.ico`. Keep source art in
`assets/icon.png` if you want, but the Windows resource step only embeds `.ico`
files. Use a multi-size `.ico` that includes at least `16x16`, `32x32`,
`48x48`, and `256x256` images.

### Install Git Hooks

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
.\scripts\install-hooks.ps1
```

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
bash scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

Both scripts install pre-commit, pre-push, and commit-msg hooks that enforce
quality gates locally before CI.

The Clippy gate uses `scripts/check-platform-clippy.sh` on shell-based setups
and `scripts/check-platform-clippy.ps1` on Windows PowerShell. The host target
still runs with `--all-targets`, while the other supported target lints
`--lib --bins` so Linux-only and Windows-only cfg issues fail locally without
requiring a foreign C toolchain for Criterion's benchmark dependency.

## Quality Gates

All of the following must pass before merging:

| Gate | Command                                                                  | Purpose                                             |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `cargo fmt --check`                                                      | Consistent formatting                               |
| 2    | `scripts/check-platform-clippy.sh` / `scripts/check-platform-clippy.ps1` | Zero lint warnings across Linux + Windows cfg paths |
| 3    | `cargo test`                                                             | All tests pass                                      |
| 4    | `cargo bench --no-run`                                                   | Benchmarks compile                                  |
| 5    | `cargo build`                                                            | Debug build succeeds                                |
| 6    | `cargo doc --no-deps`                                                    | Documentation builds                                |
| 7    | `cargo deny check`                                                       | No vulnerable/banned deps                           |

CI runs on every push to `main` **and** on every pull request targeting `main`,
so cross-platform issues (Linux + Windows matrix) are caught before a PR is merged.

Workflow dependencies in `.github/workflows/` are pinned to full commit SHAs.
When updating an action, keep the trailing version comment (for example `# v6`)
so reviewers can see the intended upstream release at a glance.

The current icon integration is intentionally Windows-only. Linux packages stay
CLI-only and do not install a desktop entry, so shipping only an icon image
would not surface a meaningful application icon in Linux menus.

For environment-specific diagnostics while developing, run the CLI with
`RUST_LOG=debug` to enable tracing for Docker/Podman probing and enrichment
fallbacks. In PowerShell, use `$env:RUST_LOG = 'debug'; cargo run -- --all`.

### Releasing

Releases are created via the **Release** workflow (`Actions` tab):

1. Go to `Actions` > `Release` > `Run workflow`.
2. Enter the version tag (e.g. `v0.2.0`).
3. GitHub groups auto-generated release notes using [.github/release.yml](.github/release.yml).
   Apply the appropriate PR labels before merging if you want a change to land
   in a specific section.
4. The workflow builds binaries for all targets, uploads `.tar.gz`, `.deb`,
  `.rpm`, and raw `.exe` assets, and creates a draft release with
  auto-generated release notes.
5. Review and publish the draft on the GitHub Releases page.

## Project Structure

```
src/
  main.rs        — CLI parsing, command dispatch
  lib.rs         — library crate root (module re-exports for benchmarks)
  types.rs       — PortEntry struct shared across all modules
  collector.rs   — socket enumeration + enrichment orchestration
  filter.rs      — user-specified and relevance filtering logic
  display.rs     — table and JSON rendering
  docker.rs      — Docker/Podman port detection via socket API
  framework.rs   — app/framework detection from images, configs, processes
  project.rs     — project root detection via cwd/cmd marker walk
```

### Architecture Boundaries

- `collector.rs` owns all OS interaction. No platform-specific code elsewhere.
- `filter.rs` owns all filtering logic.
- `display.rs` owns all rendering logic.
- `docker.rs`, `framework.rs`, and `project.rs` provide best-effort enrichment only.

Interactive table output also emits a shortcut footer on stderr. Preserve that
stdout/stderr split when changing display behavior so piped data stays clean.
Keep the renderer terminal-width aware as well: wide columns should shrink
cleanly instead of forcing the table past the right edge.

## Coding Standards

- **Clippy:** `all + pedantic + nursery` at deny level
- **Error handling:** `anyhow::Result` with `.context()`
- **No `unwrap()`** outside of tests
- **Doc comments** on every public item
- **Functions ≤ 100 lines**, cognitive complexity ≤ 30
- **No `dbg!()`, `todo!()`, `unimplemented!()`**

## Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`,
`ci`, `chore`, `revert`.

## Testing

- Unit tests live in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` inside each module
- Use `assert_eq!` with descriptive messages
- Tests requiring network access or elevated privileges should be `#[ignore]`-d
- Current table output includes an `ADDRESS` column in both default and `--full` views; update README examples in the same commit if column order or naming changes

```bash
cargo test
```

---

## Dependency Policy

- Prefer `std` over external crates
- Only MIT / Apache-2.0 / BSD / MPL-2.0 licensed crates
- `cargo deny check` must pass
- Do not add new dependencies without maintainer approval
